This repository complements the paper titled "Pairwise Comparison Evolutionary Dynamics with Strategy-Dependent Revision Rates: Stability and $\delta$-Passivity", and accommodates two Python files. 

The first file, named "RM_Smith_upper_bound.py", comprises the code that numerically approximates the maximum worst case revision rate ratios under which the RM-Smith protocol is $\delta$-passive. In order to get the upper bounds resulting from the RM-Smith protocol, set the number of strategies (n) to the desired value in the file named RM_Smith_upper_bound.py and run the code.

The second file, named "Find_NE_of_HPG.py", contains the code that finds the Nash equilibria of the HPG for the DRAM market, constructed in Section VI-A.

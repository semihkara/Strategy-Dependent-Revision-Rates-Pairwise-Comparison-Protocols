This repository complements the paper titled "Stability of Evolutionary Dynamics with Strategy-Dependent Revision Rates: Pairwise Comparison Protocols", and 
accommodates the codes that numerically approximates upper bounds for ratios of revision rates under which the RM-Smith protocols is $\delta$-passive.

In order to get the upper bounds resulting from RM-Smith protocol, set the number of strategies (n) to the desired value in the files named RM-Smith_upper_bound.py
and RM-BNN_upper_bound.py run the code.

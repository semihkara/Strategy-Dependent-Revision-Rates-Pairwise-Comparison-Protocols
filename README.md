This repository complements the paper titled "Pairwise Comparison Evolutionary Dynamics with Strategy-Dependent Revision Rates: Stability and $\delta$-Passivity",
and accommodates the code that numerically approximates upper bounds for worst case revision rate ratios under which the RM-Smith protocol is $\delta$-passive.

In order to get the upper bounds resulting from the RM-Smith protocol, set the number of strategies (n) to the desired value in the file named RM_Smith_upper_bound.py and run the code.
